#### Git Projects
- Hangman Pool
  - Electron node.js app.
  - Designed for a raspberry pi touch screen to track pool win/loss history for different player combinations.
  - Also keeps track of stripes vs solids during gameplay.
  - Future plans to include a hangman game between each player combination. When one player gets +10 in wins-losses other player loses hangman game.
